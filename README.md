# Budget
This is a budgeting program.  It helps you visualize spending and follow a budget with some work.
That work is categorizing regularly, creating a budget with dollars per day as a measurement, 
creating a savings plan (a percentage basically) and creating 2 more things: a MandatoryMap and a XcldFromCashFlow map.

All of these let you get a hold of your finances and really figure out what's going on as well as give you a guideline,
followed by your plan, to your spending.

To run this program download either the linux branch or the master branch.
If it's the master branch there should be a file called FinanceMac.jar
After creating the appropriate files (in the source code for now) run the program as follows:
java -cp FinanceMac.jar <path to your base directory where you keep all of the output files> <path and file to Chase & StarOne files>
There are 2 arguments above in between the <>.

Here are the names of the files:
